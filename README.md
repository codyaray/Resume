The LaTeX file can generate four resumes for four different types of firms:
- software engineering
- control/robotics engineering
- telecommunications engineering
- innovative approaches to education

Note: the first page remains mostly the same, except for the Computer Skills section. The section page highlights projects more relevant to each of the four "buckets".
