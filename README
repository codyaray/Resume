The LaTeX file can generate four resumes for four different types of firms:
- software engineering (e.g., Groupon or many other tech startups)
- control/robotics engineering (e.g., Dynamic Robotics in Chicago)
- telecommunications engineering (e.g., Motorola)
- innovative approaches to education (e.g., Sudbury, Waldorf, or Montessori schools; Dept of Education)

Note: the first page remains mostly the same, except for the Computer Skills section. The section page highlights projects more relevant to each of the four "buckets".
